    "#### Additional Hints for \"Unrolling\"\n",
    "* To unroll the tensor, we want the shape to change from $(m,n_H,n_W,n_C)$ to $(m, n_H \\times n_W, n_C)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tf.reshape(tensor, shape)` takes a list of integers that represent the desired output shape.\n",
    "    * For the `shape` parameter, a `-1` tells the function to choose the correct dimension size so that the output tensor still contains all the values of the original tensor.\n",
    "    * So tf.reshape(a_C, shape=[m, n_H * n_W, n_C]) gives the same result as tf.reshape(a_C, shape=[m, -1, n_C]).\n",
    "* If you prefer to re-order the dimensions, you can use `tf.transpose(tensor, perm)`, where `perm` is a list of integers containing the original index of the dimensions. \n",
    "    * For example, `tf.transpose(a_C, perm=[0,3,1,2])` changes the dimensions from $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$ to $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$.\n",
    "    * There is more than one way to unroll the tensors.\n",
    "    * Notice that it's not necessary to use tf.transpose to 'unroll' the tensors in this case but this is a useful function to practice and understand for other situations that you'll encounter."
